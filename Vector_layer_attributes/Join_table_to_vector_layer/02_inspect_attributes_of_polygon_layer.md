This lesson's project contains, among others, a polygon layer called
*Blocks 2010* and a tabular (non-spatial) layer called *2010_demographics*.

![projects_layers](projects_layers.png)

Let's inspect the *Blocks 2010* and confirm that there is no
demographic data in it.

* In the **Layers Panel**, right-click the *Blocks 2010* layer and
  select **Open Attribute Table**.

* In the Attribute table dialog, confirm that all fields are referent
  to the blocks information and that no population or habitation fields are present.

    Also, note that there is a *GEOID10* field that contains a unique
    identifier for each block feature

* Close the *Blocks 2010* Attribute table

Click **Next step** once you are done.
