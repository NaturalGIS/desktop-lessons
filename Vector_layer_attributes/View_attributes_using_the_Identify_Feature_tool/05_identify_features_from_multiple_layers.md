To see the attributes of another layer's features, you could click it in
the *Layers Panel* and use the Identify Feature tool as before.
Alternatively, you can change the Identify Features tool **Mode** to
take into account more than one layer at the same time.

- In the **Identify Results** panel, set the **mode** to ``Layer
Selection`` using the dropdown menu.

Using *Layer Selection* mode, when you click the map canvas, you will get
results from all the layers in the project.

- Click the map canvas over a building that is inside a park.

- The tool shows a context menu giving you the option to select
which layer you wish to get results from. Choose the last option,
**Identify all**.

- The **Identify  Results** panel lists features from all layers.
Moreover, in the Map Canvas, several features are highlighted in
red. If necessary, click the small icon next to the layers name to expand
its contents.

Note that, once again, if you click on a feature attribute in the
**Identify Results** panel, only that feature will be highlighted in the
map canvas, helping you identify to which feature the attributes belong.

**Note:** Going to **Project > Project Properties...**, in the
**Identify layers** tab it's possible to define which layer are
identifiable by the Identify Features tool.

Click **Next step** once you are done.
