One of the tools that allow inspecting vector layers attributes is the
*Identify Features* tool.

By default, the *Identify Features* tool mode is set to *Current Layer*,
which means that, before we can enable it, we need to have an active
layer.

As an example, for this lesson, we want to check some buildings
attributes. Therefore, we need to make the corresponding layer active.

- In the **Layers Panel**, click the *Buildings* layer, so it becomes
the active layer.

Now, with an active layer, we can enable the *Identify Features* tool.

- In menus, go to **View > Identify Features**.

- Alternatively, you can click the **Identify Feature** button in the
**Attributes toolbar**.

Click **Next step** once you are done.
