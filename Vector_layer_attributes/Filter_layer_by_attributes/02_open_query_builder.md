For this lesson, as an example, we want to filter the *Census_blocks_2010*
to show only the blocks from the Tract `050400`.

- To open the filter **Query Builder**, in the **Layers Panel**,
right-click the *Census_blocks_2010* and choose **Filter...**.

- Alternatively, having the *Census_blocks_2010* layer active,
you can use the menus, **Layers > Filter...** to open the **Query Builder**.

The **Query builder** opens.

Click **Next step** once you are done.
