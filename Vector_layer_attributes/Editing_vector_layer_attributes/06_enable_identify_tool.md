Since we set the identify features tool mode to *Current Layer*, we need
to have an active layer before we can use it. Since we want to edit a
feature in the *buildings* layer, we need to make sure it's active.

- In the **Layers Panel**, click the *Buildings* layer, so it becomes
the active layer.

Now, with *Buildings* as the active layer, we can enable the
*Identify Features* tool.

- In menus, go to **View > Identify Features**.

- Alternatively, you can click the **Identify Feature** button in the
**Attributes toolbar**.

Click **Next step** once you are done.
