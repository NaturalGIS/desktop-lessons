# Edit multiple features attributes

In previous lessons, we have shown how to edit attributes feature by
feature, using the attribute table or the feature form, and how to
update a column for all the features, using the field calculator. In
this lesson, we will cover how to edit/update only selected features and
how to edit multiple fields of the selected features.

**Estimated time:** 15 minutes
