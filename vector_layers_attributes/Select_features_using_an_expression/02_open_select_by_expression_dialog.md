Before you can use the **Select features using an expression**, you need
to activate the layer where you want to select features from.

For this lesson, as an example, we will use the *Buildings* layer. We
will want to select all Commercial building with an area bigger than
30000 sq.ft.

- In the **Layers Panel**, click the *Buildings* layer to make it active.
