You now know how to create and modify a layer's filter. It's time to learn
how to clean all filters to show all the layer features again.

- Open the filter **Query Builder**, in the **Layers Panel**,
right-click the *Census_blocks_2010* and choose **Filter...**.

- Alternatively, having the *Census_blocks_2010* layer active,
you can use the menus, **Layers > Filter...** to open the **Query Builder**.

Once you click, the lesson will move to the next step.
