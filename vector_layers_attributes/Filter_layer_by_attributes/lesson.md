# Filter layer by attributes

In projects that use vector data, one of the common needs is to filter a
layer only to show certain features. This functionality is useful when
you don't want to create an independent subset on disk for a particular
project. In QGIS, this can be done using the Layer Filter functionality.
This lesson shows how to create, edit and clear a layer's filter.
