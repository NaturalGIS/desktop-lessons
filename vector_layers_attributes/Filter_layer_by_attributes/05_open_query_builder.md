Let's say we want to change the current filter, for example, to add also
blocks from Tract `050100`.

- Open the filter **Query Builder**, in the **Layers Panel**,
right-click the *Census_blocks_2010* and choose **Filter...**.

- Alternatively, having the *Census_blocks_2010* layer active,
you can use the menus, **Layers > Filter...** to open the **Query Builder**.

Once you click, the lesson will move to the next step.
