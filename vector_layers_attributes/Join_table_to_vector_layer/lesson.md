While working with Vector layers, it is common to have non-spatial data,
in tabular form, that needs to be appended to spatial data for visualization.
In QGIS, assuming both datasets have a common field, you can use table
joins for that purpose.

In this lesson, we will see how to join a table to a vector layer and
use the result for styling the layer.
