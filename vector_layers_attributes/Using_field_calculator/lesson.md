# Using the field calculator

In a previous lesson, we have seen how to edit a feature's attributes
either by using the attribute table or the feature form. But often we
need to update an attribute for all the layer features. For that
kind of operation, we can use the Field Calculator. In this lesson, we
will use the Field calculator to update an existing field, to create
a new field and to create virtual fields based in an expression.

**Estimated time:** 20 minutes
