tool finds a single feature.

- In the **Identify Results** panel, enable the **Auto open form**.

**Note:** With the **Auto open form** enabled, if closed, the **Identify
results** panel may not pop up automatically. Nevertheless, you can
open it from **View > Panels > Identify results**, or by identifying
more than one feature.

Click **Next step** once you are done.
