When you are done with editing the layer attributes (or geometries), you
should turn off editing for the layer.

- In the Attribute table toolbar, click the **Toggle edit mode**.

- Alternatively, you can use a similar button located in the *Digitizing
toolbar*, in QGIS's main window, or right-click the *Buildings* layer in the
*Layers Panel* and choose *Toggle Editing*.

**Note:** If you try to turn off editing before saving your changes, a
warning message will prevent you from losing any work by mistake. This
can also be used to revert any unsaved changes by clicking **Discard**.
