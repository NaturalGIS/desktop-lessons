A (sometimes) more convenient way of editing attributes is using the
feature form through the **Identify Features** tool, as it allows you to
choose which features to edit, directly in the map.

First, we need to make sure the **Identify Features** tool settings are
correct.

- If not visible yet, enable the **Identify Results** panel in **View >
Panels > Identify Results**

- In the bottom, make sure the mode is set to `Current layer` and that
the **Auto open form** is enabled.

Ith this settings, when you click on a single feature from the currently
active layer on the map canvas, the corresponding **Feature Attributes**
form opens.

Click **Next step** once you are done.
