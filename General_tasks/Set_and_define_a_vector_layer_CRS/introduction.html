    As you can see in the map canvas, the <i>Wake_BlockGroup_2010</i> layer seems shifted relatively to the rest of the project. This kind of issues is usually a sign that the layer's Coordinate Reference System (CRS) may be wrong or incomplete (that is, lacking the transformation parameters). We need to fix it before we can use the layer correctly.
</p>
<p>
    There are two ways of fixing the problem:
    <ul>
        <li>Setting the correct CRS within the project.</li>
        <li>Defining the layer's CRS in the source file.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    We will start by setting the correct CRS within the project.
