            As you can see, the <i>Wake_BlockGroup_2010</i> layer seems shifted relatively to the rest of the project. This may happen if data's CRS definition is wrong or incomplete. We need to fix this before we can use this  layer correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            One way of fixing it is to set the correct CRS within the project. Let's do it.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the <b>Layers Panel</b>:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Click the <i>Wake_BlockGroup_2010</i> layer's name to make it active.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             The layer's item should be highlighted.
        </p>
