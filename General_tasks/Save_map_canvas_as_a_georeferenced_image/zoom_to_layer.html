	We will use the current map canvas's size and extent to create a georeferenced image. Therefore, the first step will be to set the canvas the way we need it.
</p>
<p>
	For this lesson, we want to focus on the Wake County, so let us zoom to it.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Right-click over the <i>Wake_Boundary_2010</i> Layer in the <b>Layers Panel</b> and choose
	<b>Zoom to layer</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
	<img src="zoom_to_layer.png">
</p>
<p>
	<b>Tip:</b> you can also resize the map canvas, by resizing QGIS's window and lateral panels.
