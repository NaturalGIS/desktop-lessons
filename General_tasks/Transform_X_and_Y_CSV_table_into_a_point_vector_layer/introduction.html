  Often, spatial data is not provided in a spatial format per se, like a shapefile or a GeoJSON file. Instead, it's
  given as a simple list of coordinates in a Comma Separated Values (CSV) text file.
</p>
<p>
  QGIS has a dedicated tool to open this kind of files called <b>Add delimited text layer</b>. In this lesson, we
  will load a CSV file containing a list of locations as X and Y coordinates, and convert it into a GeoPackage.
