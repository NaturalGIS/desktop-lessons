  In the previous lesson, we have seen how to export raster layer using the <b>Translate</b> tool from the Raster menu. In this lesson, we will use a similar processing tool instead.
</p>
<p>
    Although the tools' objectives are the same, processing tools ofter extra functionality. In this particular case:
    <ul>
        <li>You can use the tool chained with other processing tools in a model</li>
        <li>You can run the tool in batch process, which means you can select and export several layers in one go with different settings for each.</li>
        <li>You can subset the raster to a particular extent</li>
        <li>You have more control over the output format</li>
        <li>For some settings you can use expression builder to choose the value</li>
</ul>
