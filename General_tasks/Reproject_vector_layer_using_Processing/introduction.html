    <ul>
        <li>the tool can be chained with other processing tools in a model</li>
        <li>You can run the tool in batch process, which means you can select and reproject several layers in one go.</li>
        <li>It's possible to reproject to a temporary layer</li>
        <li>For some settings you can use expression builder to choose the value</li>
</ul>
