  In complex projects, it's not difficult to have tens of layers loaded, but usually, the user only needs/wants to
  see a couple of them at the same time. Moreover, in some workflows, the user may need to swap between layers'
  combinations regularly.
</p>
<p>
  QGIS allows the user to save the layers' visibility status as presets in the project. Presets can be used to
  exchange between different layers combinations quickly and can be used in the map composer as well. This lesson
  will show how to create presets and how to use them in the map canvas.
