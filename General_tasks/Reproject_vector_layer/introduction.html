  Because of their different properties, Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) are the backbone of cartography
  and spatial analysis. Therefore, being able to transform spatial data from one CRS to another &mdash; also
  know as "reprojecting" &mdash; is vital in any GIS software. In QGIS, to reproject a vector layer, all you
  need to use is the simple "Save as" tool over a loaded layer.

    Also, as in many other open source GIS tools, QGIS makes use of EPSG authority codes to single identify different CRSs.

    This lesson's project contains a layer named <i>Wake_Fire_Stations</i>, which Coordinate Reference System(CRS) is <i>EPSG:2264 (NAD83/North carolina)</i>. In this lesson, we will reproject it to EPSG:4326 (WGS 84 Geographic Coordinate System).
