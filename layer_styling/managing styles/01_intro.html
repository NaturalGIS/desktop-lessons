  <p>This lesson's project contains one layer called <i>Wake BlockGoup 2010</i>. The layer is already styled using a graduated symbol showing population density (as inhabitants by square mile).</p>

  <p>Now, let's imagine that we need a different style to show the house units occupation percentage for using in another map, but we want to keep the original one for further use.</p>
  <p>One solution could be duplicating the layer. Fortunately, there is no need for that, as QGIS allows you to store multiple styles in the same layer.
