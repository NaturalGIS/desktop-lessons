<p>This lesson's project has a layer with Wake public schools. Currently, only the position of each school is represented in the map using a circular marker.</p>

<p>If you analyze the data's attribute table, you will find a capacityto field with the students capacity. In the next steps, we will create proportional symbols using that field.</p>

<p>In the <b>Layers Panel</b>, click the <i>Wake_Public_Schools</i> layer to make it active.</p>

<p>The <i>Wake_Public_Schools</i> layer should be highlighted now.</p>
