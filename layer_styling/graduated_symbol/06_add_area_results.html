  <p>The layer's style in the map canvas should look much different.</p>

  <p><img src="add_area_results.png"></p>

  <p>The classes in the <b>Layers panel</b> show strange values, though. Yhe interval's values are close to zero because the layer's units are in feet.So, we are representing the number of inhabitants by square feet.</p>
