On the map canvas, you should confirm that all the features of the
*Raleigh_Downtown* layer are represented with a simple fill style,
with hollow polygons with a dashed blue outline.

But, if we zoom a bit more, sometimes it's hard to tell what's inside

with the previous one. That's what we will do in the next steps.
