<p>In the <b>Layers panel</b>, the legend should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="set_update_rule_results.png"></p>
<p>Now, besides beings colored by type, some of the buildings will also be drawn with a red outline around it.</p>
<p>Note that, by default, rules are applied from top to bottom. Which means that the rules in the lower part of the rules' list will be the last ones to draw, and will draw in the map canvas on top of all the others. Nevertheless, you can control this behavior by setting Symbol levels in the layer's properties, which is out of the scope of this lesson.</p>
<p>This step ends the lesson, click <b>Finish</b></p>.
