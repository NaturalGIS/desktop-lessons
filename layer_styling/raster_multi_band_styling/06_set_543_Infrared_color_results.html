  <p>As you can see, the image has changed again. For Landsat 8, the 543 combination is called "Infrared Color", and it's useful to highlight vegetation, which is shown in Red.</p>

  <p>Other band combinations can be set, but the method is always the same. Please, try it yourself. For example, try the 764 combination, which is called "False Color" and it's useful to distinguish urban areas.</p>
