  <p>Categorized and graduated symbols are great when you want to show different symbols in the same layer, but you need to use a fixed type of discrete or continuous attribute values.</p>
  <p>QGIS has another symbology renderer called Rule-base Symbols, where you can establish rules (or filters), and decide how to symbol features that match those rules. Rules can overlap each other (the same feature can be rendered using different rules, hence different symbols) and can be nested inside another rule.</p>
  <p>This lesson will cover the basics of rule-based symbols.</p>
