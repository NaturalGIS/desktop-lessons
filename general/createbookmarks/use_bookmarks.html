    Now that we have spatial bookmarks, we can quickly zoom to the bookmarks' locations.
</p>
<p>
    In the <b>Spatial Bookmarks Panel</b>, do:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the <i>Raleigh</i> bookmark line.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Zoom to bookmark</b></li>
    <p><img src=zoom_to_raleigh_bookmark.png></p>
</ol>
<p>
    The map canvas should zoom to the previously saved extention around Raleigh.
</p>
<p>
    Try reapeating the above steps but for the the <i>Wake county</i> bookmark. After doing it, the map canvas should now show the Wake county full territory.</p>
<p>
    Once you are done, click <b>Move to next step</b> to finish the lesson.
