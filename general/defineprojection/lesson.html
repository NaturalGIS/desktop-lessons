<h1>
    Define vector layer's CRS
</h1>
<p>
    This lesson shows how to set and define a vector layer's CRS. Setting the layer's CRS will apply to the current project only, while defining the CRS will apply to the data itself, making it permanent and usable in other projects. This step is crucial for the correct use of vector layers in QGIS correctly.
