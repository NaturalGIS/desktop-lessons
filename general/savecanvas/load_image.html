<p>
	In the <b>Open a GDAL Supported Raster Data Source</b> dialog:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Browse to a folder where you saved the map canvas image.</li>
	<li>Select the <i>my_map_canvas.png</i> file.</li>
	<li>Press <b>Open</b></li>
</ol>
<p>You will be prompt to choose the image's Coordinate Reference System. The <b>Save as image</b> tool always uses the current project's CRS. So, for this example, in the <b>Coordinate Reference System Selector</b> choose <i>WGS84 / Pseudo Mercator (EPSG:3857)</i></p>
<p>
	The image will open in the map canvas. At first glance, it will look like if you have turned the all the layers back on, but zooming in and out will show that it's in fact an image, that is placed exactly over Wake County location.
