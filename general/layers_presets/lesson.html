<h1>
    Create layer visibility presets
</h1>
<p>
    QGIS allows the user to save the layer's visibility status as presets in the project. Presets can be used to swap between different layers combinations quickly and can be used in the map composer as well. This lesson will show how to create presets and how to use them in the map canvas.
