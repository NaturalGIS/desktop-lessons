   Now that we have two presets, we can quickly swap between them (or any other combination). In the <b>Layers Panel</b>:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Click the <b>Manage Layers Visibility</b> button to expand its options.
    </li>
    <li>
        Choose <b>Services Points</b>.
    </li>
    <p>
        <img src="usepresets.png">
    </p>
</ol>
<p>
    You will notice that the layer's visibility changed to the previous combination.
</p>
<p>
    Try going back to the <i>Heatmap only</i> preset by your own.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have finished, click <b>Move to next step</b> to end the lesson.
