    Now, that we have the current layers visibility saved, let's create a new combination. In the <b>Layers Panel</b>:

<ol>
    <li>
        Disable the checkboxes next to <i>Wake_EMS_Station</i>, <i>Wake_Fire_Station</i>, <i>Wake_Police_Station</i>, and  <i>Wake_Public_schools</i> layers to turn their visibility off.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enable the checkbox next to <i>Services heatmap</i> layer to turn its visibility on.
    </li>
